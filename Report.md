# Unified AI-Powered Edge Assistant
## Architecture, Code, and Deployment Report

### Project Aim
- To create an intelligent, offline-capable assistant on a Single Board Computer that interacts via voice,
understands visual inputs, analyzes sensor data, and performs smart automation at the edge.
Architecture
### This assistant integrates:
- Speech recognition (Vosk or Whisper.cpp)
- Text-to-speech (pyttsx3 or Coqui TTS)
- Computer vision (OpenCV with Haar cascades or YOLO)
- Sensor analytics using GPIO inputs (temperature, motion)
- Optional local LLM (LLaMA.cpp for natural language understanding)

### LLaMA.cpp Integration
To add LLM capabilities locally without internet, use LLaMA.cpp via llama-cpp-python:
1. Install llama-cpp-python:
 pip install llama-cpp-python
2. Download a quantized GGUF model (e.g. from HuggingFace).
3. Example usage:
 from llama_cpp import Llama
 llm = Llama(model_path="./models/mistral-7b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf")
 response = llm("What is the temperature today?")
 print(response['choices'][0]['text'])
4. Integrate into your voice assistant after command parsing.
### Conclusion
With voice, vision, sensors, and LLMs running entirely on-device, this Edge Assistant can serve in
autonomous, offline environments such as smart homes, farms, factories, or accessibility solutions.
